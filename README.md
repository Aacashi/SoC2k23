# Dive into the World of Quant
This repository contains code and analysis for predicting stock prices firstly using technical analysis and fundamental analysis. After that we have code the market indicators and implemented momentu trading using ML. And finally coded a few alphas on the WorldQuant Brain Platform and tested them withe realtime data.
For the momentum tradiing:
This repository contains code and analysis for creating and managing an investment portfolio using a momentum trading model. The project aims to leverage momentum strategies to construct a portfolio that maximizes returns by capitalizing on the continuation of existing market trends.

Overview
Momentum Trading Model: A strategy that involves buying securities that have shown an upward price trend and selling those with a downward trend.
Portfolio Management: Techniques and tools for constructing and rebalancing a portfolio based on momentum signals.
Features
Data Collection: Scripts to fetch historical market data for a wide range of securities.
Momentum Calculation: Code to calculate momentum indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD).
Portfolio Construction: Algorithms to select securities and allocate funds based on momentum signals.
Backtesting: Tools to evaluate the performance of the momentum-based portfolio using historical data.
Visualization: Graphs and charts to visualize momentum signals, portfolio composition, and performance metrics.
